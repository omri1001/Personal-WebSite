The "EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND" section includes information about the student's current enrollment in a computer science program at HIT - Holon Institute of Technology, as well as their GPA and extensive knowledge of programming and computer applications.

The "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE" section lists the student's work as a math and computer science teacher in a high school, as well as their involvement in several student mentoring and excellence projects.

The "Get In Touch" section provides contact information for the student, including their phone number and email address, as well as a button to send an email to them.
